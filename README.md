# 24sessions One-to-One Communication Sample App

This app demonstrates how to start using 24sessions API and build video communication app just with few lines of code. 

For convenience we have built simple JS SDK around REST API that can be found in `jssdk` directory.

Main functionality is located in [demo/index.html](demo/index.html).

AppID and PrivateKey used in the app are for testing purposes only and can be changed in any moment. Signup at [24sessions.com](https://24sessions.com) to receive own access credentials if you'd like to use API for a real project.

24sessions REST API documentation can be found at: [docs.24sessionsapi.apiary.io](http://docs.24sessionsapi.apiary.io/)
